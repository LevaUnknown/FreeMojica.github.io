        <h1>DON'T TRANSFER MOJICA!</h1>
        <p>We have come to find out that Mr. Mojica will be transferred to a different school. We asked multiple 7th and 8th graders how they feel about this, and NONE of them agree with this decision. So on behalf of all 7th and 8th graders, we would like to complain about his transfer and explain why he shouldn’t be transferred. Why are you transferring him? Do you have a reason? Because we would LOVE to hear it. The reason we don’t think he should be transferred is because he is genuinely a good teacher. He listens to kids, helps them solve problems (not just math related), and doesn’t get mad over small mistakes. He also explains things in multiple different ways so students can understand better. Students feel comfortable talking to him and can even relate to him in some ways. That connection actually makes a big difference. He makes us motivated, makes learning fun, and he is reliable. It may seem like these are common things teachers do, but it really isn’t. You guys need teachers, right? Then why get rid of one of the BEST teachers?</p>
        <p>So ending on that, I hope you take notice of our complaints and at the very least tell us why he is being transferred.</p>
        <p><strong>Sincerely,<br>7th and 8th grade.</strong></p>
